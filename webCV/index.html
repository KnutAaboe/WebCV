                I am currently on my last semester of my Information Technology bachelor’s degree at
                <a href="https://www.hvl.no/en/studies-at-hvl/study-programmes/2018h/inf/utdanningsplan/" target="_blank"><strong>HVL Bergen</strong></a>. 
                This semester I am doing my bachelor task with Stacc Insight and taking a compressed course which goes through
                SDK, C++, C# and .NET. I'm always eager to learn more, and trough
                my bachelor I have gotten a good basic knowledge with different programming languages and algorithms.</p>

            <div class="soknad">
                <p>I am a 22 year old man, who moved from Stavanger to Bergen to take a bachelor’s degree in information technology at
                Western Norway University of Applied Sciences. I decided to do this after I completed my certification as a
                CNC-operator. Due to the oil crisis, there was a decline in the labor market, which is why I decided to go back to
                school. I am happy I moved to Bergen to experience more than just my own city, and also get to meet new people and a new
                environment. I chose this education because I enjoy making products I can be proud of. I especially enjoy starting with
                a project from scratch. In my opinion there is always something new to learn, which is why I like experimenting with
                different code solutions.

                                <h3>Work</h3>
                                <p>In the past I have mainly worked as a CNC operator, and in industrial workshops. In addition, I have some experience
                                from reception work and working as an assistant in kindergartens. With my varied work experience, I have learned the
                                importance of planning and quality assurance of goods and products. I have experience with independent work, but I am
                                also good at cooperating with others. These are qualities I take with me, going forward.</p>

                                engaging in projects with friends who share my interests. In my spare time I like to experiment in the kitchen, as well
                                as hiking in the mountains. I always try to find a balance between time spent in front of a screen and doing other
                                activities.

                        <p>I'm currently taking my bachelor's degree at Western Norway University of Applied Sciences where we have gone through
                        Java, Python, Javascript, HTML, CSS, SQL. We have also worked with databases in our application using PostgreSQL, used
                        Junit testing, and used java for the front-end using tomcat and servlets and JSP. We have also learned different kinds
                        of frameworks like REST, managing frameworks like Agile and Scrum, and algorithms runtime on different kinds of lists
                        and methods. Additionally, I chose courses that focused on javascript, like Ajax, HTML-DOM, etc. Some of my other
                        courses focused on functional programming, where we used Haskell. Lastly, I chose a course about machine learning with
                        extra algorithms. Current semester I am writing my bachelor thesis, and taking a compressed course that goes through
                        C++, C#, SDK, and .NET.
                        <br>
                        Besides programming courses, we have had courses that teaches you how to start a business from a project. Here we
                        learned about subjects like budgeting, funding ideas, how to find out if an idea is a good idea etc. We also had some
                        math courses that teaches you about statistics, truth tables, vectors, algebra, linear problems, matrix problems etc.
